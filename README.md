Automated Workflow for Knowledge Wrangling, Analysis, Retrieval and Discussion

# 📌 What is AWKWARD?

AWKWARD is a local, reproducible assistant designed to help researchers query, compare, and understand their own scientific literature.

It ingests a collection of academic PDFs, indexes them semantically, and allows you to ask natural-language questions exclusively based on those documents, with explicit citations to the original articles.

No internet knowledge.
No hallucinated references.
Just your papers — intelligently queried.

🎯 Why AWKWARD?

During a PhD, literature grows faster than human memory.

AWKWARD aims to:

- centralize scientific articles in one place

- enable semantic search (by meaning, not keywords)

- assist with synthesis, comparison, and explanation

- remain transparent, traceable, and reproducible

- be simple enough to share within a lab

It is not a replacement for reading papers.
It is a tool to read them better and faster.
